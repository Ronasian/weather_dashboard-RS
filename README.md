# Challenge 6: Weather Dashboard

## Description
This webpage will display a weather forecast for a given city from user input. The site will feature a search bar where users can search any city. Information in the city's forecast will include weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Also, cities that are searched will be added to a search history, so that users can access that cities information again without having to retype information in the search bar.
